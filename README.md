# Production-and-Freight-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Dana

Dana Incorporated is an American supplier of axles, driveshaft, transmissions and
electrodynamics, thermal, sealing, and digital equipment for conventional, hybrid, and
electric-powered vehicles. The company has been analysing its production using traditional
methods. We aim to build a dashboard which can make the analysis more interactive and
detailed using Power BI, along with Visual interpretation of the raw data with the help of
statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. Data analytical tool such as
Power BI is used to provide visual interpretation of the data with the help of statistical graph.
This process simplifies the complexity of the data analysis and provides user friendly
interface to understand the business statistics. Production and Loss Analysis, Freight
Prediction and Freight Analysis will provide insights on how the company performs over a
period of time, along with reasons for the loss incurred. To achieve this, we have
implemented few Machine Learning models. For the Freight analysis, the number, of trips
took by transporter to deliver the goods to particular customers and the cost for the same is
calculated and visualized.

The client can add data of each month and refresh the dashboards to visualize and
take further decisions. This visual representation provides key metric to make on the go
decisions and the model predicts the supply chain cost.

The data will not be made available as it is the company's data.
However the visuals of the dashboard are available in the document above.
